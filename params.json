  "body": "### Abstract\r\nRGB-D cameras and depth sensors have made pos- sible the development of an uncountable number of applications in the field of human-computer interactions. Such applications, varying from gaming to medical, have made possible because of the capability of such sensors of elaborating depth maps of the placed ambient. In this context, aiming to realize a sound basis for future applications relevant to the movement and to the pose of hands, we propose a new approach to recognize fingertips and to identify their position by means of the Microsoft Kinect technology. The experimental results exhibit a really good identi- fication rate, an execution speed faster than the frame rate with no meaningful latencies, thus allowing the use of the proposed system in real time applications. Furthermore, the scored iden- tification accuracy confirms the excellent capability of following also little movements of the hand and it encourages the real pos- sibility of successive implementations in more complex gesture recognition systems.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
